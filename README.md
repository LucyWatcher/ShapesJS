# Summary
This is my first JS script that is longer than a couple lines. **In few words: the Program draws a grid of moving shapes on an HTML5 Canvas**. 
 + The shapes have several animated properties, like their size. 
 + The shapes in the demo respond to mouse interaction. 

***You can see this script as a webpage via GitHub Pages <a href="https://lucywatcher.github.io/ShapesJS/">HERE!</a>.***

This is my first ever GitHub Repository. I am using this Repo to learn how to develop alongside GitHub. Later, I want to learn `GIT` itself on my PC command line, to ensure I understand everything. 

Because I was a beginner, Much of this code is **VERY** unoptimized
